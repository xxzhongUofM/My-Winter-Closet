Note: Python 3 is needed. https://www.python.org/downloads/

1) Open terminal and navigate to root directory of project.

2) python3 scrapper.py

3) Navigate to http://localhost:5000/. If that doesn't work, change the port number to whatever your terminal says.
   Example: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Last 4 digits is the port number).

The following dependicies may be needed, depending on whether you system as them installed or not.

pip3 install flask

If you run into an internal server error, restart the flask app and press command/ctrl + shift + R to perform a hard refresh.
